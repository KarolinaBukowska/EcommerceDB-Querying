# Ecommerce DB Querying

## Purpose üéØ  

This repository serves as a comprehensive showcase of my proficiency in applying SQL within the context of a QA Engineer's responsibilities. Specifically tailored to the needs of an ecommerce web application, I've developed a mock database for the purpose of executing SQL queries aimed at data validation. The goal is to demonstrate not only technical competence but also the practical application of SQL within an ecommerce system.

### SQL Skills Demonstrated in This Repository üõ†Ô∏è

**Basic SQL SELECT:**
Utilized fundamental SELECT statements to retrieve specific data from the database.
**SQL CASE to Filter Records:**
Applied SQL CASE statements to dynamically filter and categorize records based on specified conditions.

**INNER JOIN:**
Demonstrated the use of INNER JOIN to combine data from different tables, enhancing query capabilities.

**Insert and Delete Queries:**
Implemented SQL INSERT queries to add new data and DELETE queries for efficient data removal.

**Constraints:**
Utilized constraints such as PRIMARY KEY and FOREIGN KEY to maintain data integrity and enforce relationships between tables.
